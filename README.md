# Binary Search Challenge
### Creating a program to search through an array 

This project takes a hard coded array of names and allows a user to search it. It sorts the names alphabetically and then performs a binary search to locate the name. 

I used a name generator website to create the list of names. Have not yet tested to see how this would work with more than single names.
